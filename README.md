# The Swiss Fertility Project

An app/presentation for the Developing Data Products course project, created by Patrick Simon (August 3rd 2019)

## Introduction

Welcome to my Github Pages site for the final course project in the Developing Data Products class. I have created a Shiny App for visualization and fitting of the standard `swiss` dataset in R. There's also a pitch presentation that I created using RStudio Presenter.
